# Stoic Epigrams

---

# Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

If you are pained by any external thing, it is not this thing that disturbs you, but your own judgment about it. And it is in your power to wipe out this judgment now.

---

# Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Things stand outside of us, themselves by themselves, neither knowing anything of themselves nor expressing any judgment.

---

# Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

Today I escaped from anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside.

---

# Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

[It is] like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or that this noble vintage [wine] is rotted grapes… perceptions like that... latching onto things and piercing through them, to see what they really are… to strip away the legend that encrusts them.”
