# Stoic Epigrams: Redefining External Events in Light of Internal control

This is a collection of Stoic Quotes designed to help you realize that you can only control that which is within yourself, and to remind you that mastering your response to your emotions and to the outside world takes all their power and gives it to you. The Stoic Sage is thereby satisfied in hunger, drunk in dryness, free in chains, and just in injustice. No man can take that which you have for yourself: your power over your rational mind. These quotes are to remind you of the place you hold in the web of Fate, and the power you possess within yourself, and the power you lack to change the unchangeable.
